In my HTML document I used:

        BootStrap - for styling

        JQuery - for easy and smooth navigation

        FontAwesome - so I could use their free icons

        Animate.Css - So that we can animate elements without custom animations.



Some issues I encountered when making this website:

I had issues with the padding on my navigation bar. Thanks to a lot of help, I didn't need to add padding to each section - rather adding a jQuery code that sets the top offset by my navigation height and it worked! We also needed to use a different version of JQuery to get this to work as well.
